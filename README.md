Here is my Arduino code for the DCS AV-8B UFC. It displays the UFC Scratchpad data on an SSD1322 OLED,
while the two UFC Comm Preset Displays are shown on two SSD1306 OLED screens. Additionally,
it makes the Master Caution and Master Warning LEDs blink accordingly.

The project is still a Work in Progress (WIP), meaning the 3D files for printing are not available yet. A Thingiverse link will be shared soon.

SSD1322 (SPI) → show data from UFC Scratchpad Display

SSD1306 (I²C) → shows data from UFC Comm1 Preset Display und UFC Comm2 Preset Display
